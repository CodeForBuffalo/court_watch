# court_watch


### This is a (prototype) website for court watch in Buffalo.

### Very condensed background information on the issue:

When people first go to court, they generally having their full hearing set for a later date.  To make sure people return to court, judges often set a monetary bail that the person must pay in order to go free until that hearing date.  There are two main problems here:  

a) If a person cannot pay bail, they are held in jail without having yet been convicted of a crime.  They can lose their job, apartment, or children in the time they spend in jail waiting for trial.
b) Judges do not take into account a person's wealth or income when setting bail.  So, this problem disproporitionately affects the poor and people of color.
