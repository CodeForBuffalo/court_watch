          <p class="lead">Box 1. The Cost of a Judgeâ€™s Discretion
The defendant was a 23-year-old black man, who was charged with misdemeanors
including marijuana possession and trespass. At first, the judge decided that the defendant
was eligible for the Release Under Supervision (RUS) program; he would not have to pay
bail and would not be detained pretrial. The defendant then told the judge that he had
been mistreated at the Erie County Holding Center the night before, while waiting for his
arraignment. After the defendant was seated again, waiting for a RUS representative, he
slouched in his chair with what the judge perceived as a negative attitude. The judge told
him to sit up, and when he did not comply the judge called him back to the stand. The
defendant complained again about his treatment at the Holding Center, and the judge
stated, "If you're acting like this in front of me, I can only imagine what you were doing at
the Holding Center." When the defendant protested, she continued, "If I want to put
$100,000 bail on you for acting silly in here, I can do that." Apparently due to the judge's
dislike of the young man's demeanor, bail was set for $5,000 cash or insurance bond. </p>
